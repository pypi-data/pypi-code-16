    """An interface for classes that should have a container.

    Primarily used by the IocContainer, any class that subclasses it will
    have the container it was called from automatically injected into it.

    This allows classes to use the container as a service locator.

    By defining a __ioc_definition__ on the class, any class that is retrieved
    from the container that hasn't been defined can create itself based off
    the definition.

        container (watson.di.container.IocContainer): A reference to the container
        __ioc_definition__ (dict): A definition required to create the object
